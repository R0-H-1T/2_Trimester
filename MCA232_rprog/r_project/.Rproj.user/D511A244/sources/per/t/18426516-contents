## Perceptions :
### 1. I believe seminars and webinars are effective for enhancing student engagement
```{r}
believe_frequency <- data$Perception.of.Webinars...Seminars..I.believe.seminars.and.webinars.are.effective.for.enhancing.student.engagement.
belief_df <- data.frame(Response = believe_frequency)
belief_df$Response <- factor(belief_df$Response, levels = c("Strongly disagree", "Disagree", "Neutral", "Agree", "Strongly agree"))
ggplot(belief_df, aes(x = Response, fill = Response)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "count") +
  labs(title = "Belief in the Effectiveness of Seminars and Webinars", x = "Response", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```
The graph is showing the distribution of people's beliefs about the effectiveness of seminars and webinars for enhancing student engagement.
By looking at the heights of the bars for each belief level, you can get an idea of how many people in the dataset hold a particular belief. For example, if the bar is tall for "Agree," it means that a significant number of people believe that seminars and webinars are effective for enhancing student engagement.


### 2. The convenience of webinars influences students' participation.
```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = as.factor(data$What.is.your.current.level.of.education.), y = as.factor(data$Perception.of.Webinars...Seminars..The.convenience.of.webinars.influences.students..participation..))) +
  #geom_count(aes(color = data$Perception.of.Webinars...Seminars..The.convenience.of.webinars.influences.students..participation.., size = 3)) +
  geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0), size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Webinar Convenience and Student Participation",
       x = "Education Level",
       y = "Perception") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Strongly disagree" = "red",
                                "Disagree" = "orange",
                                "Neutral" = "yellow",
                                "Agree" = "green",
                                "Strongly agree" = "blue"))
```
The scatter plot shows how individuals' education levels correlate with their perceptions of how the convenience of webinars influences student participation. It represent varying levels of agreement or disagreement, offering a visual overview of potential patterns or trends in these associations.



### 3 .Webinars are better at accommodating students' busy schedules compared to seminars.
```{r}
temp_data <- data.frame(
  Education_Level = data$What.is.your.current.level.of.education.,
  Webinar_Response = data$Perception.of.Webinars...Seminars..Webinars.are.better.at.accommodating.students..busy.schedules.compared.to.seminars..
)

mosaicplot(table(data$What.is.your.current.level.of.education., data$Perception.of.Webinars...Seminars..Webinars.are.better.at.accommodating.students..busy.schedules.compared.to.seminars..),
           main = "Perceptions of Webinars Accommodating Busy Schedules",
           color = c("red", "green", "blue", "yellow", "purple"),  
           cex.axis = 0.7,
           las = 4)
```

### 5. Seminars encourage active participation among students.
```{r}
education_levels <- c("High School", "Undergraduate (Bachelor's degree)", "Graduate (Master's or higher)", "Others (please specify)")

# Create a factor with specified levels
data$What.is.your.current.level.of.education. <- factor(data$What.is.your.current.level.of.education., levels = education_levels)

# Create a grouped bar chart
ggplot(data, aes(x = `What.is.your.current.level.of.education.`, fill = data$Perception.of.Webinars...Seminars..Seminars.encourage.active.participation.among.students..)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", color = "black", stat = "count") +
  labs(title = "Active Engagement: Seminars Inspiring Student Participation",
       x = "Education Level",
       y = "Count",
       fill = "Response") +
  theme_minimal()
```
The code creates a grouped bar chart illustrating the distribution of responses to the statement "Seminars encourage active participation among students" across different education levels. Each bar represents an education level, and the colored segments within each bar indicate the count of responses for various levels of agreement. The chart visually captures how perceptions of seminar effectiveness vary among education levels.



## Exploring the Relationship Between Education Level and Webinar Preference

```{r}

library("readxl")
web_sem_data <- read_excel ("webinars_and_seminars.xlsx")
head(web_sem_data, 3)


first_test <- web_sem_data %>%
  rename(
         education_level = `What is your current level of education?`,
         webinar_preference = `Perception of Webinars & Seminars [Webinars are better at accommodating students' busy schedules compared to seminars.]`
    )


first_test$education_level <- factor(
  first_test$education_level, 
  levels = c(
    "High School", 
    "Graduate (Master's or higher)", 
    "Undergraduate (Bachelor's degree)", 
    "Others (please specify)"
    )
  )


first_test$webinar_preference <- as.integer(
  factor(
    first_test$webinar_preference,
    levels = c(
      "Strongly disagree", 
      "Disagree", 
      "Neutral", 
      "Agree", 
      "Strongly agree"
    )
  )
)
 

 

model <- lm(webinar_preference ~ education_level, data = first_test)
# Summarize the model
summary(model)


first_test <- data.frame(
  education_level = c("High School", "Graduate (Master's or higher)", "Undergraduate", "Others"),
  webinar_preference = c("Neutral", "Agree", "Disagree", "Neutral")
)




# Create a plot
ggplot(first_test, aes(x = education_level, y = webinar_preference)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = webinar_preference), size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue") +
  geom_abline(h = 3, color = "blue") +  # Add a horizontal line at y = 3
  labs(title = "Regression Plot: Education Level vs. Webinar Preference",
       x = "Education Level",
       y = "Webinar Preference")



```




### Interpretation:
Hypotheses:
Null Hypothesis (H0):

There is no significant relationship between education level and webinar preference.
Alternative Hypothesis (H1):

There is a significant relationship between education level and webinar preference.
p-value of 0.1309 is higher than the typical level of significance (e.g., 0.05), which results to reject the null hypothesis at the chosen significance level.
In the context of your regression analysis, a p-value above 0.05 suggests that there is no strong statistical evidence to conclude that education level has a significant impact on webinar preference.



## Analyzing Time Investments: A Study of Online Learning Hours by Education Level

```{r}
second_test <- web_sem_data %>%
  rename(
    education_level = `What is your current level of education?`,
    hours_spent = `How many hours per week do you spend on online learning activities, including webinars and seminars?`
  )


second_test$hours_spent <- as.integer(
  factor(
    second_test$hours_spent,
    levels = c(
      "Less than 1 hour", 
      "1-5 hours", 
      "6-10 hours", 
      "More than 15 hours"
    )
  )
)

head(second_test$hours_spent, 9)


second_test <- data.frame(
  hours_per_week = c("Less than 1 hour", "1-5 hours", "6-10 hours", "More than 15 hours"),
  education_level = c("Graduate", "Undergraduate")
)




second_test$hours_per_week_numeric <- 
    ifelse(second_test$hours_per_week == "Less than 1 hour", 0.5,
           ifelse(second_test$hours_per_week == "1-5 hours", 3,
                  ifelse(second_test$hours_per_week == "6-10 hours", 8,
                         ifelse(second_test$hours_per_week == "More than 15 hours", 17.5, NA))))


t_test_result <- t.test(hours_per_week_numeric ~ education_level, data = second_test)
  
print(t_test_result)
```

### Null Hypothesis (H0):

The null hypothesis typically assumes that there is no significant difference between the mean hours spent per week for "Graduate" and "Undergraduate" groups.

### Alternative Hypothesis (H1):
The alternative hypothesis suggests that there is a significant difference between the mean hours spent per week for "Graduate" and "Undergraduate" groups.

Conclusion: Failed to reject the null hypothesis.
Inference: There is insufficient evidence to suggest a significant difference in the mean hours spent per week between "Graduate" and "Undergraduate" groups.
