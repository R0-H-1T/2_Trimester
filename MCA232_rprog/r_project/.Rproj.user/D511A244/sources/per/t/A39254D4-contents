### Interpretation:
#Hypotheses:
#  Null Hypothesis (H0):
  
#  There is no significant relationship between education level and webinar preference.
#Alternative Hypothesis (H1):
  
#  There is a significant relationship between education level and webinar preference.
#p-value of 0.1309 is higher than the typical level of significance (e.g., 0.05), which results to reject the null hypothesis at the chosen significance level.
#In the context of your regression analysis, a p-value above 0.05 suggests that there is no strong statistical evidence to conclude that education level has a significant impact on webinar preference.

### Null Hypothesis (H0):
#The null hypothesis typically assumes that there is no significant difference between the mean hours spent per week for "Graduate" and "Undergraduate" groups.

### Alternative Hypothesis (H1):
#The alternative hypothesis suggests that there is a significant difference between the mean hours spent per week for "Graduate" and "Undergraduate" groups.

#Conclusion: Failed to reject the null hypothesis.
#Inference: There is insufficient evidence to suggest a significant difference in the mean hours spent per week between "Graduate" and "Undergraduate" groups.
