Movie Name:


create cinemas such as hollywood, bollywoord, animation, cartoon

can perform operation such as
    - difference between the box offices of the cinemas
    - sort the matrix based on the ratings, profits, 
    - create average, median, mode of each cinema 


1. You can create mean of the 2 matrices

2. Subtraction of the two matrices to get the comparision, preferably the rating 

3. Put an element at a position.

4. We can find the percentage of a particular field of the matrix - Range, mean



Calculate the percentage difference between the two matrices, 
which can be an indicator of how much more or less one set of earnings is compared to the other.
The formula is (Matrix 1 - Matrix 2) / ((Matrix 1 + Matrix 2) / 2) * 100.

percentage change in earnings between two matrices: 
(Matrix 1 - Matrix 2) / Matrix 2 * 100
