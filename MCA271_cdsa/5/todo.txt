partition algorithm - 2 approaches


take 2 pointers  - left and right
consider the last element of the array to be the pivot

move the left pointer towards the end of array until an element greater than the pivot is encountered.
move the right pointer towards start  of the array until an element smaller than the pivot is encountered.

once found, swap the elements.
