Abstract classes in java
Can create actual concrete methods in abstract classes

Every method in an interface is assumed to be abstact.
You can implement multiple interface, also u can implement an interface and extedn a class

Ever data member in interfaces is static and final, thats youll have to instantiate the data member
at the time of decleration - public int age = 34;
But in abstract class tells that it needs to have these many data members but its not going
to tell what it is. Ever object will have its own value for them.
