Difference between Abstract classes and interfaces in jave




Any fields that is declare in the interface is static and final 
So every class that is implementing this interface will have this fields.
You will need to instantiate it with some value at the time of decleration
THATS WHY DON'T HAVE FIELDS IN INTERFACES LIKE:
int age = 1;

You use abstract class in such cases
